# Known Issues

## Android

* When using the SN30 Pro XBox Controller on Android, the triggers are reversed. Use the shoulder buttons instead.

## Windows

* The input bindings for Nintendo Switch controllers are incredibly weird.

    I'm frankly not sure what's causing this, but the Y button (on a GameCube style controller) acts like the A button,
    and clicking in the C Stick acts like Start. For now, I'd recommend using a PS4, PS5, Xbox 360, Xbox One, or Stadia controller instead.
    (Why can't every controller and OS just standardize on Xinput????? UGH)
