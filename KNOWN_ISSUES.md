# Known Issues

* Not all menus can be controlled via gamepad

Unfortunately, this was my first major project with Godot, so I didn't really
take the best advantage of its scene and theming architecture.
As a result, the UI is kinda all over the place.
Sorry about that.

* The pause menu can get stuck if you hit the wrong button

I hope to fix this.

* My replica N64 gamepad is mistaken for a PS3 controller

Uh... yeah.
